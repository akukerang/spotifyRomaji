# spotifyRomaji
Converts Japanese songs to romaji, only in web-based Spotify. Uses a content script to call a python server to convert song titles into romaji, using pykakasi.
## **How to use:**
1. Run python server
2. Load unpackaged extension, with developer mode on. _(I'll package it later, maybe...)_
3. Go to open.spotify.com

timing wonky, sometimes replaces current song with last song. fixes itself after sometime.
